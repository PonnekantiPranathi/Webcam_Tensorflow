# Webcam_Tensorflow
The files that I have used to create the webcam are attached above. I did this project on the 'glitch.com' platform.
This project is done to identify multiple objects through the webcam through the 'Object Detection ML' module in Tensorflow.
The webcam identifies some basic and regular objects like Persons, cats, dogs etc and draws a box around the same telling that the webcam has detected the object with some x% of Probabililty.
